You run as fast as you can. The armoured man laughs. He looks at you intently while you run away from him. He smirks and starts running towards. The man is toying with you like a leopard toying with its prey. Overcome with fear for you life, you try running as fast as possible. Suddenly, you stumble on a stone and fall over. You turn over, only to be greeted by the death reaper, assuming the form of the armoured man.
"Goodbye! You motherfucking bastard! Burn in hell!!!", he says, as he plunges a sword in your stomach. Blood rushes out of abdomen as the last bits of life escape you. You think to yourselves what wrong and horrible things had you done in your past, that you were met with this fate. You start splurting blood and darkness starts filling you sight. 
You know end is near. But the questions about your past still seem to bother you more. You know those answers will never be know to you and you regret that. You take a deep breath and breathe out your last breath.
YOU DIED !!!
