You run towards the sword, trying to pick it up. The short mercenary runs towards you. He charges at you. You reach the sword, scrambling to pick the sword. He raises his sword, shouting, "You are dead, boy!!!".
You turn around and plunge the sword in his chest. Blood splurts out of his mouth and lands on your legs. Panting, you get up and start running towards the gate, not looking back.
You finally reach the gate, out of breath. You finally feel secure and safe. You look back at the burning village, trying to comprehend what this place meant you. But nothing comes to mind. You start walking towards the mountain. You are safe for now.
SUCCESS!!!
