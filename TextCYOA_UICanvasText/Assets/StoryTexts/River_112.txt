Afraid foe your life you start running upstream. The armoured man charges at you, his face red with blood. You start running up the river.
In the distance, you see a human figure. You scream "Help me!!". The man in the distance raises his hand, waving at you. You start to feel you can survive. As the blurry figure becomes clear, you notice the same tiger crest; this time red in colour. You start slowing down. Panic and fear start taking over. You realize that you have no way of escape.
Suddenly, a sword pierces your back and comes out of your stomach. You realize that this is the end. As the sword starts moving upward, life starts escaping your body. You meet the most gruesome end one can hope for.
YOU DIED!!!
