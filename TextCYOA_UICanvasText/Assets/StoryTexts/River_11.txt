The man, now burning with rage, charges at you. Trying to avoid his attack, you roll over to your right. But the longsword gets you, scaping your left arm.
Having missed twice, the anger and frustation now become visible on his face.He looks at you, with eyes as red as the fire blazing the village. He charges at you again, now with more aggression than before.
You stay still, waiting for an opening. The man lift his sword to attack. In a swift swing, you throw a handful of sand in his eyes.
"Ahh!!", screamed the man. Knowing that this is your chance to escape, you get up at once.
