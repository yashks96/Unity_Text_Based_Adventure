You take the sword out of man's stomach. The blood starts gushing out of his abdomen. The blood on the blade glimmers in the amber light of fire. You drag yourself, with the blade in your right hand. You notice a large tree, blocking your path. You turn around and decide to take another route. You are about to take to the next turn, when suddenly you hear some noises.
"Did you find him?" , said the large, tall man covered in armour, sporting a red tiger crest.
"No luck here. But man, if we dont retrive the boy, the chief is gonna get really mad. ", said the other man, shorter than the first one, also covered in armour with a red tiger crest.
Not knowing what to do, you decide to confront those men. You charge towards the large man with your sword raised. The men looking in the other direction, do not notice. You plunge the your sword in the tall mercenary's back. 
The blood starts splurting out blood. In a swift move, you take the sword out of the man's abdomen. The man falls to the ground, blood gushing out of his back.
Suddenly, the other man hits your hand, knocking the sword out of your hand.
