You pick up the bow and quiver of arrows. You look down at the man again, wondering about your connection with him. You drag yourself, with the quiver of arrows and bow hung over your shoulder. You notice a large tree, blocking your path. You turn around and decide to take another route. You are about to take to the next turn, when suddenly you hear some noises.
"Did you find him?" , said the large, tall man covered in armour, sporting a red tiger crest.
"No luck here. But man, if we dont retrive the boy, the chief is gonna get really mad. ", said the other man, shorter than the first one, also covered in armour with a red tiger crest.You decide to shoot down the two mercenaries. You nock your arrow and wait for your moment. The men turn around looking at the mountains.
"I still can't believe the chief went to this length to achieve his goals.", said the tall men.
Suddenly a arrow pierces his heart. The man falls down with a thud. The other men looks in disbelief. He turns around only to have his neck pierced by another another. Blood starts gushing out of his mouth as he falls down. You walk over to them, give them an emotionless and indifferent stare. You start walking towards the gate, still wondering about your past. 
You reach the gate. You finally feel secure and safe. You look back at the burning village, trying to comprehend what this place meant you. But nothing comes to mind. You start walking towards the mountain. You are safe for now.
SUCCESS!!!
