The air smeels of ash and smoke. You open your eyes and all you can see is a ruby coloured haze. You try to get up but its difficult. "My arm hurts like hell!", you think. Then you look up, and notice you are in hell. The small village houses are burning, engulfed in the crimson fires of hell. You try to think of what happened here? But your head hurts. You try to remember but nothing comes to mind. You Look around to figure things out. But nothing makes sense. You nothing a burned down house behind you. Reduced to ashes, the bright red embers still emanate from its site. Your instinct tells you to get out of the village.
Fear and panic start to take over your mind, but you heart is filled to the brim with sadness and agony. You feel like screeming but do not have the energy for it.You notice the grandeous mountains far North of the village, looking like Satan dark pits of hellfire right now. You turnaround to see in the other directions. 
There is river behind the burned down house. It gray water resemble the Styx, carrying the damned souls of this poor village. You know you have to leave. Which way should you go?

->Go North towards the Mountains
->Follow the course of the river.
