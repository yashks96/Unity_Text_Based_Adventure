Judging from the armour of the man, you infer that the man won't be able to follow you into the river. You run towards the river. The man tries to follow, but the sand in his eyes is making him slow. With a giant splash, you enter the cold waters of the river. Tired to the bone, you allow the water current to take you along. You see the armoured man in the distance, fuming. 
You have avoided death for the day. But questions about your past still encircle your mind. With no recollection of your past, you know you have a long journey ahead of you. But for now you close your eyes, filling you head with a happy melody.
SUCCESS!
