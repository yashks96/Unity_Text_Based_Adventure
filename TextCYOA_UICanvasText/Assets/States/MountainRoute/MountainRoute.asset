  storyText: "You decide you have to get out of this place at once. At a distance,
    you see a large gate.\r\n\"Village Entrance!\", the thought pops in your head.\r\nThe
    gate appears to be in the north-eastern side of town and and seems to lead up
    to the mountain. You start on the road to the gate. You walk along the road, witnessing
    the rampage and ruin the fires of hell have brought forth. Suddenly, your foot
    hits something  and you stumble. You look down to see a man, lying in his own
    pool of blood. With a sword in his stomach, he appears to be a village guard,
    perhaps a soldier. With blood coming out of his abdomen and mouth, he whispers.\r\n\"GET
    OUT!!!\", his warning comes with his final breath.You see a bow and a quiver,
    full of arrows, lying next to him.\r\n->Take the sword out of his stomach\r\n->Pick
    up the bow and arrow.  \r\n"
