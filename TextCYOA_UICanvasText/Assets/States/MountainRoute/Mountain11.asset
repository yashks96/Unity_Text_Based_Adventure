  storyText: "You run towards the sword, trying to pick it up. The short mercenary
    runs towards you. He charges at you. You reach the sword, scrambling to pick the
    sword. He raises his sword, shouting, \"You are dead, boy!!!\".\r\nYou turn around
    and plunge the sword in his chest. Blood splurts out of his mouth and lands on
    your legs. Panting, you get up and start running towards the gate, not looking
    back.\r\nYou finally reach the gate, out of breath. You finally feel secure and
    safe. You look back at the burning village, trying to comprehend what this place
    meant you. But nothing comes to mind. You start walking towards the mountain.
    You are safe for now.\r\nSUCCESS!!!\r\n\n(Press 1)"
