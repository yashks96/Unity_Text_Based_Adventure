  storyText: "Afraid and full of fear, you start running towards the gate. The other
    mercenary shouts, \"You are not gonna get away from me!\".\r\nHe starts running
    behind you. Fearing for your life, you start running faster. Your flight instinct
    takes over, you stop thinking about surroundings. Suddenly, a large signpost hanging
    from the roof of a store falls. You try to roll over to avoid it, but end up hurting
    your knee. You try to get up and start running, but pain is too intense to ignore.
    You still get up and and start walking as fast as you can.\r\nSuddenly, you feel
    a seering pain in your back. You fall down. You roll over and see the short mercenary,
    smiling.\r\n\"The chief will be pleased!\", as he bring down his sword on you.\r\nYOU
    DIED!!!\n\n(Press 1)"
