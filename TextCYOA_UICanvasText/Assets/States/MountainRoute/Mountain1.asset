  storyText: "You take the sword out of man's stomach. The blood starts gushing out
    of his abdomen. The blood on the blade glimmers in the amber light of fire. You
    drag yourself, with the blade in your right hand. You notice a large tree, blocking
    your path. You turn around and decide to take another route. You are about to
    take to the next turn, when suddenly you hear some noises.\r\n\"Did you find him?\"
    , said the large, tall man covered in armour, sporting a red tiger crest.\r\n\"No
    luck here. But man, if we dont retrive the boy, the chief is gonna get really
    mad. \", said the other man, shorter than the first one, also covered in armour
    with a red tiger crest.\r\nNot knowing what to do, you decide to confront those
    men. You charge towards the large man with your sword raised. The men looking
    in the other direction, do not notice. You plunge the your sword in the tall mercenary's
    back. \r\nThe blood starts splurting out blood. In a swift move, you take the
    sword out of the man's abdomen. The man falls to the ground, blood gushing out
    of his back.\r\nSuddenly, the other man hits your hand, knocking the sword out
    of your hand.\r\n->Try picking the sword.\r\n->Start running towards the gate. "
