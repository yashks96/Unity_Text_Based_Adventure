    dagger. Sparks fly off, as steel brushes against steel. Alresdy knowing you were
    in no state to win, you come up with a plan. The man, now burning with rage, charges
    at you. Trying to avoid his attack, you roll over to your right. But the longsword

    now become visible on his face.He looks at you, with eyes as red as the fire blazing
    the village. He charges at you again, now with more aggression than before.\r\nYou
