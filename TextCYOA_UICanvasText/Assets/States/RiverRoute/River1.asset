  storyText: "You walk along the bank of the river, the clear waters of which have
    turned a dark red. Exhausted and in pain, you try to make sense of it all. You
    want to figure out everything about yourself and how it came to be. But the desire
    to get out of this amber hell takes priority over everything else.\r\nSuddenly,
    you feel a seering pain on your back. You fall down, screaming in pain. You turn
    your face to find cause of your latest suffering. A huge burly man looks down
    on you. Covered in armour and a white tiger crest, he speaks through his open
    visor.\r\n\"I have finally found you!, you little snake!\", he says. Unaware of
    the context, you stare at him. Still in pain, you wonder why is he trying to hurt
    you. You look up at him, only to find a longsword coming down on you. You roll
    over to your left, narrowly avoiding the blow. \r\nTaken over by fear, you notice
    something shining in the grass. It is a dagger. You the notice the armoured man
    running towards you.\r\n->Pick up the dagger from the grass.\r\n->Run away from
    the armoured man. "
