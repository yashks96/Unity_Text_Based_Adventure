  storyText: "Afraid foe your life you start running upstream. The armoured man charges
    at you, his face red with blood. You start running up the river.\r\nIn the distance,
    you see a human figure. You scream \"Help me!!\". The man in the distance raises
    his hand, waving at you. You start to feel you can survive. As the blurry figure
    becomes clear, you notice the same tiger crest; this time red in colour. You start
    slowing down. Panic and fear start taking over. You realize that you have no way
    of escape.\r\nSuddenly, a sword pierces your back and comes out of your stomach.
    You realize that this is the end. As the sword starts moving upward, life starts
    escaping your body. You meet the most gruesome end one can hope for.\r\nYOU DIED!!!\n\n(Press
