  storyText: "You drag yourself to the river. Parched, you bend down to quench your
    thirst. The water acts as ambrosia for your tired soul and weary body. You wonder
    how you came to be at this place and what happened here.\r\nAs you are about to
    take a second gulp, you notice an object floating in the river. It seems to be
    covered in some sort of immiscible fluid. As the body draws near, you come to
    know the true identity of the object, to your horror. \r\nA lifeless, half-charred
    corpse of a woman passes by you, as it is being taken by the current downstream.
    The fluid which you noticed earlier was the dried up blood, still not ready to
    curdle with water and make it a crimson red.\r\nYou look at the upper bank of
    the river and then you look towards the mountain.\r\n->Go towards the mountain.\r\n->Follow
    the river upstream."
