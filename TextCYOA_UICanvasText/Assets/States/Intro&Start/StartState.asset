  storyText: "The air smells of ash and smoke. \nYou open your eyes and all you can
    see is a ruby coloured haze. You try to get up but its difficult. \"My arm hurts
    like hell!\", you think. Then you look up, and notice you are in hell. The small
    village houses are burning, engulfed in the crimson fires of hell. You try to
    think of what happened here?  But your head hurts. You try to remember but nothing
    comes to mind. You Look around to figure things out. But nothing makes sense.
    There is a burned down house behind you. Reduced to ashes, the bright red embers
    still emanate from its site. Your instinct tells you to get out of the village.
    Fear and panic start to take over your mind, but you heart is filled to the brim
    with sadness and agony. You feel like screeming but do not have the energy for
    it.\nYou notice the grandeous mountains far North of the village, looking like
    Satan dark pits of hellfire right now. You turnaround to see in the other direction.
    There is river behind the burned down house. It gray water resemble the Styx,
    carrying the damned souls of this poor village.You know you have to leave. Which
    way should you go?\r\n\t-> Go North towards the Mountains\r\n\t-> Follow the course
    of the river. "
